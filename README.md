1. to run the project, firstly create a virtual environment. I used venv.
to create it use such commands:
python -m venv name_of_env
path to env folder\name_of_env\Scripts\activate.bat
2. to install all the required libs, run:
pip install -r "path to reqirements.txt"
However, there are no required libs - in requirements.txt only version of venv, which was used in this project.
3. to launch the menu enter:
python -m tictactoe
4. to deactivate your venv, tap in cmd:
deactivate
